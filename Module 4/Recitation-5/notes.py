t is important to highlight that recursion is never required to solve a problem. Any problem that can be solved recursively can also be solved with a loop. In fact, recursive algorithms are usually less efficient than iterative algorithms. This is because the process of calling a function requires several actions to be performed by the computer. These actions include:

Allocating memory for parameters and local variables,
Storing the address of the program location where control returns after the function terminates
These actions, which are sometimes referred to as overhead, take place with each function call. Such overhead is not necessary with a loop. However, some repetitive problems are more easily solved with recursion than with a loop. Where a loop might result in faster execution time, some problems are easily solved with recursion than with a loop, and you will study those problems in later computer science courses.
